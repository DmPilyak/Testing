Task #2
Ð¢his task is to find the shortest path from one graph object to another. To solve this problem, we use Dijkstra's algorithm. We search (iterate over) all paths from object to object and choose the shortest

Task #3
In this task, I used the BigInteger class to count large values. After receiving the result, I split the answer character by character and put all the parsed characters into int
